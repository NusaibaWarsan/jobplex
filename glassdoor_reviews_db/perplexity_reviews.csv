"Long hours, rewarding work, and humble colleagues
","Current employee, less than 1 year",2025-05-03,Member of technical staff,"The people that onboarded me were some of the most impressive people I've worked with. They expect a lot out of you but will spend late hours to unblock you and support you if needed. Definitely strong team mentality here given the need to ship quickly + high quality. Given the background of some of these folks, was initially intimidated at first but everyone seems incredibly humble and aware that all of us can improve.

As an aside, they recently started doing team dinners + other events, which helps me meet other team members from other departments.",Do not come if you want to work 9-5. The expectations on me in my first week were at the level that I was expected to deliver in 1 month at a larger company. This feels a lot more like a nimble Series A startup than I had expected.,Continue the dinners + more opportunities for remarkable members to showcase their work. Some of these people are doing truly novel stuff I've never seen before.,5
Hard work but the most impactful work you will ever do,"Current employee, more than 1 year",2025-04-30,Product Manager,"- More autonomy than anywhere else I have worked to run down ideas and make bets
- Culture celebrates helping each other and nobody is too busy to help you if you need it
-Very steep learning curve - you can get good at your work and be encouraged to do new things really quickly
- Getting immediate consumer feedback on product work is awesome",- Expect to work very hard. Not really a con but this is a startup so know wht to expect,Keep Shipping,5
"Fast-paced, remarkable people, high expectations all around
","Current employee, more than 1 year",2025-04-24,Member of technical staff,"The people here are super hardworking, humble, and sharp. I learn something every day about how the entire Perplexity machine works, from how we index the web to handling our massive infra and down to the various design choices of each UI. If you deliver and work hard, everyone from the team to the co-founders all notice and trust you with more responsibilities, which is shocking coming from a larger company.

","Long hours and constant need to deliver and ship so def a grind. For those that like to learn, it's fun but for many, it'll be exhausting. Also, several team members feel like we're doing too much and not focusing enough on quality.","Be aware of what employees think about product quality and continue to hire remarkable, brilliant people.",5
"strong people + useful product but quite scattered
","Current employee, more than 1 year",2025-04-17,Member of technical staff,"everyone I work with is smart and hardworking, which pushes me to learn a lot faster. a lot is expected but once you deliver, you get credit from the team.

","teams are split across various projects so can't 100% focus on one thing. coming from quant background, this could be hard to adjust to.","reduce scope and ship higher quality

"Hard work but opportunity to do your best work
","Current employee, more than 1 year",2025-03-30,Business team,"**Huge, valuable mission**
- Get to work on redefining search and how people find answers; opportunities like this come once every 20 years
- So many people love the product and rooting for us to succeed
- Company's focus on search makes it very clear what our north star metrics are and what future we're building towards

**Encouraged to do your best work**
- Founders and execs always motivate people to execute new ideas they have to improve the product, search capabilities, and internal processes
- Flat hierarchy means people tell you ""just do it"" vs. requiring 4 committees and 3 meetings to get approval from the right partners
- If you do good work, you are given limitless resources and more responsibilities to accelerate your career progression vs. stifling it like in larger orgs or companies with 10+ VPs across the org
- Controlled chaos where entrepreneurial team members can thrive

**Elite team**
- The people here from the technical staff to the workplace team are all incredibly hardworking, exceptionally talented, and humble.
- Surprised to hear that directors and VPs join as IC to contribute
- While having spectacular resumes, everyone I meet is humble and willing to meet new employees on the team","**Long hours / always on**
- Working 80+ hours/week and finishing projects over the weekend are not uncommon
- High expectations on each team member mean long hours and focus to get the job done
- Founders are always on and expect quick responses, esp. on mission-critical projects which means you're always on

**Product decisions and focus**
- Team rapidly ships new features and products every week, so some features seem like rush jobs with poor quality and various bugs
- Nearly impossible to understand why certain product decisions were made and how it's supposed to improve user experience
- So many teams working on different aspects of the product makes cross-functional communication very difficult","Better communication between teams + notifying users of changes

Awesome company,"Current employee, less than 1 year",2025-03-26,Anonymous employee,"Fast pace, growing, changing the world

"Proceed with caution
",Former employee,2025-03-26,Anonymous employee,"- Development is fast, which allows you to learn a lot - quickly","- Expect to work around the clock. While the AI space is changing rapidly and requires a need for drive, Perplexity takes this to the next level by allowing next to no boundaries with work. The CEO will regularly celebrate those in the office late into the night/on weekends, and subtly shame those who aren't. Don't expect to be able to detach long enough to get restful sleep or take a vacation. There is an extreme sense of urgency around every project, with little to no prioritisation applied.
- The founder's obsession with the twitter / the elon echo chamber fuels already huge egos, and is a distraction from meaningful work getting done.
- Claims to be an a-political company but the leadership cozies up to Trump/Musk, donated to the administration, and partners with alt-right media.
- Nearly no women work at this company because their opinions and boundaries are not respected.
- What is the differentiator for Perplexity at this point?",Do better,1
"Smart People, Toxic Culture
","Current employee, less than 1 year",2025-02-28,Anonymous employee,"Perplexity has incredibly talented people on the team. Engineers are fast, dedicated and work very hard. It’s easy to like the people you work with.

","The smart people don’t make up for the lack of leadership. The founders show no empathy, they don’t communicate with each other much less to the rest of the team. Expectations are unreasonable, everyone is overworked and when you ask for more resources you’re completely disregarded or made to feel like a failure. People get fired suddenly and unexpectedly. Don’t work here.

"good opportunity, with caveats
","Current employee, less than 1 year",2024-10-08,Member of technical staff,"Product is great - very useful and good market fit. You get to work with cutting edge technologies and smart, kind ICs. The business team is stellar. Leadership includes a number of Quora alums. Fast paced, exciting area to be in.

","Typical startup cons, just know what you're getting into. You likely won't meet deadlines unless you work nights/weekends, PTO is discouraged, and if you slow down, you're out. Very few women in tech roles (<5%). Agree with the other reviewer about lack of a clear moat, but that could change.","consider a longer exercise window

"Great people, founders are really driven

"Coldhearted and untrustworthy management.
",Former employee,2023-03-23,"Ios software engineer
","Very smart people work here

","The managment is completely untrustworthy. They will lie to your face. There is no job security. Pay is significantly below market rates, and you are expected to work long hours. The interview process is predatory. Aravind and Dennis in particular show no empathy whatsoever. Please do not work here.
